## About

This repository contains the documents used to build the [website](https://red-robby.github.io/)
that hosts my presentation materials for STAT 33B/133 at UC Berkeley. The website is
generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you'd like to generate it locally, you will need to download Quarto. You can do so [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
Once downloaded, clone the repository and run ``quarto render <directory>``.

```
git clone https://github.com/red-robby/red-robby.github.io.git your-name # or your preferred method
quarto render your-name
```

If you'd prefer to open it directly in your browser, replace the last line with the following.

```
quarto preview your-name
```
