This website is a collection of my (Jakob's) notes and presentation materials for STAT 33B. It will be updated as the semester progresses.

### Well that's not right...

If you've spotted a bug on the website or a discrepancy between my notes and the official course 
material, please let me know so it can be corrected.

_Note that in the case of a discrepancy, the official course material takes precedence._

### Source Code
