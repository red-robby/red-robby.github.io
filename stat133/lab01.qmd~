## Welcome!

Welcome to STAT 133! I'll be your uGSI, **Jakob Sorensen**.

::: incremental
-   Contact: jakobsorensen\@berkeley.edu

-   My Sections:

    -   11 AM to 1 PM  in *Evans 340*

    -   3 PM to 5  PM in *Evans 340*

## Expectations

- Weekly Lab (13 total)
- Timed Quizzes (2 total -- via bCourses)
- Biweekly[^1] -- every 2 weeks -- Homework (6 total)
- Final Exam

[^1]: Isn't it unfortunate _biweekly_ can mean twice a week _and_ every 2 weeks?

## Our Lab

- For the **first 15-40 minutes**, I'll lecture briefly on select topics from the week's 
material and/or we'll solve a few challenges together. 

- Afterwards, you are free to work on the lab, and I'm available to help. 


## My Notes

I'll be hosting the materials I create for the course at the following website:
